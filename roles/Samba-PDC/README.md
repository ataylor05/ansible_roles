# Sambda Active Directory primary domain controller
This playbook provisions a Samaba Active Directory domain controller.  BIND is used on the local domain controller(s) instead of the built-in Samba DNS.  Also Samaba is complied from source instead of using a prebuilt binary.  This was done for the inclusion of the samaba-tool program which provisions Active Directory.

## Example 
Here is an example of the main.yml file to deploy this playbook.<br>
